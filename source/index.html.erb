					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>The goal of CarlHacks is to promote programming at Carleton College, in Minnesota, and throughout liberal arts institutions in general. CarlHacks 2015 was one of the first national hackathons hosted by a liberal arts college.</p>
					<p>Hackathon definition: an event, typically lasting one to several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming. A portmanteau of "hack" (to create) and "marathon".</p>
				</div>
				<div class="center vjustify">
					<h3>Deadlines</h3>
					<p>Applications with requests for travel reimbursements are due by 12:00 am February 28, 2016, and travel reimbursement notices will be sent out by February 29.  Late applications (no trave reimbursements) are due by March 14, 2016.  Flight reimbursements will be for up to $150--buses to/from the airport and Twin Cities area schools will be announced later.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="center vjustify">
					<h3>Resources</h3>
					<p>An assortment of hardware for checkout by participants will be provided by Major League Hacking.  Meals, snacks, and coffee will be provided throughout the event, and we will have a multitude of air mattresses for you to sleep on.</p>

				<h3>Packing List</h3>
				<p>CarlHacks is completely free to attend. You'll need <strong>a laptop, charger, and student ID</strong>. We'd also recommend bringing <strong>toiletries, shower shoes, a change of clothing, and a pillow</strong>. We'll provide meals, snacks, showers, and air beds for napping. If you don't have a project idea or team, don't worry! There will be team-forming events, and we find some of our best ideas come <em>during</em> the hackathon, not before. If you come with a team, note that the maximum team size is four.</p>
